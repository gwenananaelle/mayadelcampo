As a curious artist who seeks answers and feels the world deeply, I chose to become an art therapist—a mental health practice that uses creativity across many modalities to help individuals, families, and communities navigate life’s challenges and bloom.<br>

I am a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC-A) and a Registered Art Therapist (ATR-P) in Texas, supporting children, teens, and adults through virtual art therapy and in-person group sessions. As a researcher, I completed a five-year PhD at Lesley University (Cambridge, USA), where I developed Icanfeel, an AI-powered software that supports the expression and monitoring of oncological symptoms, currently in clinical trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX).<br>

Alongside clinical work, I serve as a professor of art therapy, training future therapists across Central and South America at the Instituto Mexicano de Psicoterapia de Arte, and as a Visiting Scholar at The New School University (NY), where my research focuses on the intersection of technology, art, and mental health.<br>
